# Aether

Hey Aether is personal project of mine for my discord, I will writeup stuff about it at my blog https://nxtdaemon.xyz otherwise Aether will not be released to multiple servers; it is purely for learning Discord.py and different nuances in python. Currently Aether Has the following cogs

- Admin
- ToDoList
- Fun 

## Admin
- Modified Purge Command from an SO 

## ToDoList 
- A Mediocre ToDoList for users which has little to no room for errors

## Fun
- Slightly Modifed Poll Command from Jackbot
